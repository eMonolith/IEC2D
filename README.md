                    Inertial Electrostatic Confinement in 2-dimensions


  A game simulator of an IEC fusor that I will improve as my knowledge of 
particle system algorithems improves. There are improvements on the drawing 
board now, but I lack the knowledge to implement them in C or C++.
    As my knowledge of particle systems algorithems improves so too will IEC2D.
